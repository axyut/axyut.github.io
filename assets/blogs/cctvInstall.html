		<ol>
			<li>
				<h3 id="first">Conduct a site survey:</h3>
				Before installing CCTV cameras, you need to conduct a site
				survey to identify the areas that need to be monitored.
				Determine the number of cameras required, the type of cameras
				needed, and the best locations to install them.
			</li>

			<li>
				<h3 id="second">Develop a CCTV system design:</h3>
				Based on the site survey, create a CCTV system design that
				includes camera locations, wiring, and any necessary accessories
				such as mounts, brackets, and power supplies. The design should
				meet the client's specific requirements and budget.
			</li>

			<li>
				<h3 id="third">Select the right CCTV cameras:</h3>
				There are various types of CCTV cameras available, such as dome
				cameras, bullet cameras, and PTZ cameras. Select the right
				cameras based on the site survey and design.
			</li>

			<li>
				<h3 id="fourth">Install the cameras:</h3>
				Install the cameras in the designated locations according to the
				design. Ensure that the cameras are mounted securely and angled
				correctly to capture the required areas.
			</li>

			<li>
				<h3 id="fifth">Run the wiring:</h3>
				Run the wiring from the cameras to the central location where
				the DVR/NVR will be located. Use high-quality cables and ensure
				that they are securely fastened to prevent damage or
				disconnection.
				<ul>
					<li>
						Use high-quality cables: Use high-quality cables that
						are designed for CCTV systems. Use Siamese cables that
						have both video and power wires in one cable for easier
						installation. <br />
					</li>
					<li>
						Measure and cut the cables: Measure the distance between
						the camera and the DVR/NVR, and cut the cables to the
						appropriate length. Leave some extra length to allow for
						adjustments and future maintenance. <br />
					</li>
					<li>
						Run the cables: Run the cables through walls, ceilings,
						or conduits. Use cable clips or staples to secure the
						cables to the walls or ceilings. <br />
					</li>
					<li>
						Connect the cables to the cameras: Connect the cables to
						the cameras and ensure that they are securely fastened.
						Test the video feed to ensure that it's clear and
						stable. <br />
					</li>
					<li>
						Connect the cables to the DVR/NVR: Connect the cables to
						the DVR/NVR according to the manufacturer's
						instructions. Ensure that the connections are secure and
						tight. <br />
					</li>
					<li>
						Label the cables: Label the cables at both ends to make
						it easier to identify them in the future. <br />
					</li>
					<li>
						Test the cables: Test the cables to ensure that they are
						working properly. Check the video feed and ensure that
						the signal is not degraded<br />
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li>
				<h3 id="sixth">Install the DVR/NVR:</h3>
				Install the DVR/NVR in a secure and accessible location.
				Configure the settings such as video quality, motion detection,
				and recording duration based on the client's requirements.
			</li>

			<li>
				<h3 id="seventh">Configure remote viewing:</h3>
				Configure the CCTV system to allow remote viewing on mobile
				devices or computers. Ensure that the client can access the
				system securely and easily.
			</li>

			<li>
				<h3 id="eight">Test the system:</h3>
				Test the CCTV system thoroughly to ensure that it works
				properly. Check the camera angles, video quality, and remote
				viewing. Make any necessary adjustments or repairs.
			</li>

			<li>
				<h3 id="ninth">Provide training:</h3>
				Train the client on how to use the CCTV system, including remote
				viewing, playback, and system maintenance.
			</li>

			<li>
				<h3 id="tenth">Provide ongoing support:</h3>
				Provide ongoing support to the client to ensure that the CCTV
				system continues to work properly. Offer maintenance and repair
				services as needed. <br />

				<h3 id="eleventh">Some potential issues to be aware of:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						False alarms: CCTV systems can trigger false alarms due
						to factors such as changes in lighting, weather
						conditions, or the presence of animals. This can lead to
						unnecessary disruptions and cause people to ignore

					</li>
					<li>
						Camera malfunction: Cameras can malfunction due to
						factors such as power surges, weather damage, or
						hardware failure. This can lead to gaps in surveillance
						coverage and reduce the effectiveness of the system.
						<br />
					</li>
					<li>
						Data storage issues: CCTV systems generate large amounts
						of data, and managing this data can be a challenge.
						Issues such as hard drive failure, insufficient storage
						capacity, or data corruption can result in lost footage
						and reduce the effectiveness of the system.<br />
					</li>
					<li>
						Privacy concerns: CCTV systems can raise privacy
						concerns if they capture footage of individuals in
						public or private spaces. It's important to ensure that
						the system complies with relevant privacy laws and
						regulations. <br />
					</li>
