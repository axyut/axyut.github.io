		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>README.md</strong><br />
				<em>(required)</em> Every project should start with a
				<em>README.md</em> file, a document in
				<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/"
					>Markdown</a
				>
				format containing the essential project information (i.e.:
				<em
					>name, description, category, authors, copyright, license,
					links, contacts, ...</em
				>) and some information on how to start and contribute. The
				<em>README.md</em> file is usually rendered by the online
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control"
					><em>Versioning Control System</em></a
				>
				(<em>VCS</em>) as an HTML page on the project landing page, so
				it is effectively the entry point for anyone approaching the
				project. For this reason it is important to fill it with the
				right essential and quick-start information. Please see the
				projects in the Example section for a practical reference.
			</li>
			<br />
			<li>
				<strong>LICENSE</strong><br />
				<em>(required)</em> This file contains the license terms in
				plain text. It is usually referenced in the
				<em>README.md</em> and embedded in the software package (e.g.
				<em>RPM, DEB, or Docker image</em>).
			</li>
			<br />
			<li>
				<strong>VERSION</strong><br />
				<em>(required)</em> This is a plain text file containing the
				semantic version of the software as a
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth"
					><em>Single Source Of Truth</em></a
				>
				(<em>SSOT</em>).<br />
				This file is usually parsed by build scripts and embedded in the
				software package name and content.<br />
				For more information please read:
				<a
					href="https://technick.net/guides/software/software_versioning"
					title="Software Versioning"
					>Software Versioning</a
				>.
			</li>
			<br />
			<li>
				<strong>RELEASE</strong><br />
				<em>(required)</em> This is a plain text file containing the
				release or build number. It can be dynamically generated and
				overwritten during the packaging phase but it is better to keep
				it as a <em>SSOT</em> to test build and packaging scripts.<br />
				This file is usually parsed by build scripts and embedded in the
				software package name and content.<br />
				For more information please read:
				<a
					href="https://technick.net/guides/software/software_versioning"
					title="Software Versioning"
					>Software Versioning</a
				>.
			</li>
			<br />
			<li>
				<strong>.gitignore</strong><br />
				<em>(required)</em> Assuming that we are using GIT as VCS, this
				file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should
				ignore.<br />
				This should contain at least the dynamically generated directory
				"target" that we use to store all the logs and artifacts
				resulting from the test, build and report commands.
			</li>
			<br />
			<li>
				<strong>src</strong><br />
				<em>(required)</em> This directory contains all and only the
				project source code. It may also contain sub-directories to
				logically organise the code in packages or namespaces. For some
				languages like <em>GO</em> it also contains the unit tests
				files. This directory should not contain any static resource
				like text files, configuration files or HTML pages.
			</li>
			<br />
			<li>
				<strong>test</strong><br />
				<em>(optional)</em> For languages that do not have a mechanism
				like <em>golang</em> to distinguish source files from test
				files, this directory contains the unit test files for the
				source code defined in "<em>src</em>". Usually the test files
				have the same name suffix or prefix of the correspondent source
				files and are located in the same relative position.<br />
				This directory can eventually contains other type of tests
				organized in sub-folders, if these do not conflict with the unit
				testing system.
			</li>
			<br />
			<li>
				<strong>vendor</strong><br />
				<em>(optional)</em> This directory can be used to include
				specific versions of external projects that are dependencies for
				the main project.<br />
				Usually these dependencies are managed using a specific
				vendoring tool but in some languages they can also be filled
				manually by paying attention on using the correct sub-directory
				paths.
			</li>
			<br />
			<li>
				<strong>resources</strong><br />
				<em>(optional)</em> This directory contains all the project
				static resources and packaging configurations.<br />
				The resources that will be packaged will be added with their
				relative final destination path, following the
				<em
					><a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard"
						>Filesystem Hierarchy Standard</a
					></em
				>
				(<em>FHS</em>) to avoid breaking the
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security-Enhanced_Linux"
					>SELinux</a
				>
				rules.<br />
				For example, for a Linux service software we can have the
				following sub-folders:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>debian</strong> : contains debian-specific
						packaging files;
					</li>
					<li><strong>rpm</strong> : contains RPM spec files;</li>
					<li>
						<strong>git/hooks</strong> : contains git hook scripts
						that can be installed locally by developers;
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>test</strong> : contains resource files for
						testing;
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>DockerDeploy</strong> : contains the Dockerfile
						used to package the software as runnable Docker image;
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>etc/<em>PROJECT</em></strong> : contains the
						project configuration files (usually JSON files);
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>etc/init.d/<em>PROJECT</em></strong> : project
						init file, if required;
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>usr/share/man/man1/<em>PROJECT</em>.1</strong> :
						manual file, if required;
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>usr/share/<em>VENDOR-PROJECT</em></strong> :
						contains project static resources like HTML pages or
						templates.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<br />
			<li>
				<strong>database</strong><br />
				<em>(optional)</em> If the project has a database back-end this
				directory contains the latest full database schema (i.e.
				<strong><em>schema.sql</em></strong
				>) and the initial data (i.e. <strong><em>data.sql</em></strong
				>) used to populate the empty database.<br />
				The database changes between each version of the software should
				be added as SQL files inside a sub-directory named "<strong
					><em>patch</em></strong
				>". Each patch file should contain the reference versions
				(from-to). For example:
				<em>database/patch/schema_1.9.5-2.0.0.sql</em>
			</li>
			<br />
			<li>
				<strong>example</strong><br />
				<em>(optional)</em> If the project is a library this directory
				contains application examples.<br />
				Examples are particular important in Open Source projects but
				are also relevant for private projects as they help cutting the
				training and support time required for newcomers. Usually are
				easier and faster to understand than reading the full
				documentation.
			</li>
			<br />
			<li>
				<strong>doc</strong><br />
				<em>(optional)</em> For non trivial projects this directory
				contains all the extra documentation.<br />
				The documentation should be organised hierarchically in
				<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/"
					>Markdown</a
				>
				or HTML format. It may also contains reference documents in PDF
				format.<br />
				If the documentation is too large, too generic or subject to
				frequent changes, it is better to make it available on the
				project Website and add a link here or in the
				<em>README.md</em> file.
			</li>
			<br />
			<li>
				<strong>target</strong><br />
				<em>(dynamic)</em> This directory is intended to be
				automatically created and destroyed by various test, build and
				packaging scripts to store all the resulting logs, reports and
				artifacts.<br />
				The reason to name such directory is because:
				<ol>
					<li>
						we can easily exclude all artifacts from the
						<em>VCS</em> just by excluding this directory;
					</li>
					<li>
						the <em>CI/CD</em> systems usually do not allow to write
						anything outside the project (or pipeline) root;
					</li>
					<li>
						we can easily save or copy all the artifacts from the
						<em>CI/CD</em> system, <em>Virtual Machine</em> or
						<em>Building Container</em> just copying this directory
						without assuming anything about its content.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<br />
			<li>
				<strong>other global project files</strong><br />
				<em>(optional)</em> The project root directory should contain
				global project files, for example:
				<ul>
					<li>
						specific <em>CI/CD</em> configuration files (e.g.:
						"<em>.travis.yml</em>");
					</li>
					<li>
						configuration files for the dependency tool (e.g.
						"<em>composer.json</em>");
					</li>
					<li>
						configuration files for the unit testing tool (e.g.
						"<em>phpunit.xml.dist</em>");
					</li>
					<li>other global configuration files;</li>
					<li>
						a <em>Makefile</em> that contains standardized targets
						to execute common tasks like testing, source code static
						analysis, building, packaging, etc; so we can reuse and
						reproduce the same commands in multiple places (i.e. dev
						machines, CI/CD systems, testing systems).
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
