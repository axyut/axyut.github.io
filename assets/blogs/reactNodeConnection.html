<p>Some of the common design architectures are:

<li>3 Tier Architecture</li></ol> <br> 
<p> <strong>API vs Templating</strong>
	: This are two different ways we can have our application establish communication between frontend and backend.
<br><br><strong>1. Templating:</strong>

A template engine enables you to use static template files in your application. At runtime, the template engine replaces variables in a template file with actual values, and transforms the template into an HTML file sent to the client. This approach makes it easier to design an HTML page.
<br><br><strong>2. API:</strong>
API stands for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. Let's say the user in your school portal inputs his name and password and hits login. That will send a post request to the backend and the backend which you wrote will check if the user is real or not. If the authentication is successful the backend will send a message and the user will navigate to the portal's dashboard.
