			<h3>Prevent further damage and loss of data:</h3>
			<li>
				<p>Disconnect from the internet:</p>
				As soon as you suspect an attack, disconnect your PC from the
				internet to prevent the ransomware from spreading to other
				devices on your network or communicating with its command and
				control servers. <br />
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Determine the type of ransomware:</p>
				Identify the type of ransomware that has infected your PC. This
				can help you determine what type of ransomware you are dealing
				with and what tools and resources you can use to try to recover
				your files. <br />
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Back up your files:</p>
				If possible, back up your important files to an external hard
				drive or a cloud-based storage service. This can help you
				restore your data if you are unable to decrypt your files or if
				you decide to wipe your PC and reinstall your operating
				system.<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Scan your PC with antivirus software:</p>
				Use reputable antivirus software to scan your PC for malware,
				including the ransomware. If the antivirus software detects the
				ransomware, follow its instructions to remove it.<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Check for available decryption tools:</p>
				Some security companies and law enforcement agencies have
				released decryption tools that can help you recover your files
				without paying the ransom. Check their websites for information
				and instructions. <br />It depends on the specific ransomware
				variant. Some decryption tools are free and others may require
				payment or the help of a professional IT security expert. Some
				of decryption tools I had used:
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>Avast Decryption Tools:</p>
						Avast provides free decryption tools for some ransomware
						families, including AES_NI, Alcatraz Locker, Apocalypse,
						BadBlock, Bart, BTCWare, Crypt888, CrySiS, Globe,
						HiddenTear, Jigsaw, LambdaLocker, Legion, NoobCrypt,
						SZFLocker, and many more.
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Emsisoft Decryptor:</p>
						Emsisoft offers free decryption tools for some
						ransomware families, including Amnesia, Aurora, Damage,
						HydraCrypt, Marlboro, Nemucod, Stampado, and more.
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Kaspersky RakhniDecryptor:</p>
						Kaspersky offers a free decryption tool for the Rakhni
						ransomware family.
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>TrendMicro Ransomware File Decryptor:</p>
						TrendMicro provides free decryption tools for several
						ransomware families, including CryptXXX, Crysis, Jigsaw,
						and TeslaCrypt.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<br />
				It is important to note that not all ransomware can be
				decrypted, and even if a decryption tool is available, it may
				not work for all cases. Some ransomware variants use strong
				encryption that cannot be broken, while others have flaws in
				their encryption that can be exploited to recover the files.
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Professional help and guidelines:</p>
				If you are unable to recover your files on your own, consider
				seeking the help of a professional IT security expert or a
				specialized ransomware recovery firm. Report the attack to law
				enforcement and other relevant authorities. This can help them
				track down the attackers and prevent further attacks. <br />
				There are several reasons why paying the ransom is not a good
				idea. First, there is no guarantee that the hackers will
				actually provide the decryption key to unlock your files. Even
				if they do, there is no guarantee that the key will work or that
				they won't demand more money.
				<br />
				Second, paying the ransom encourages the hackers to continue
				their criminal activities and target other people. By paying,
				you are providing them with the financial means to carry out
				further attacks.
				<br />
				Third, there is always a risk that the hackers will use the
				information you provide during the payment process to steal your
				identity or carry out further attacks
